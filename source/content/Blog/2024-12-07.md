Hello world,

I'm starting work on my blog to document my progress on my goals, my successes
and failures that I encounter as I finally begin living my life.

The most recent success being that I got [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) working
with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)!

Things I want to improve on this blog include:

* Figuring out the titles
* More about how Quartz works in general
* Setting up a subscription to the blog for those interested
* Creating a standard page for getting into coding for newbs

Other enhancements include:

* Optimizing my peak coding time away from 9 PM to 2 AM to a slightly more reasonable time
* Or moving to where my odd hours work well with the rest of the world, we'll see
