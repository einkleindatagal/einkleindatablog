Part of the larger long term design goals for Emergent Behavior Machine (EBM)
include capturing knowledge and its associations. What this would look like in practice
is creating a graph of all possible associations between an entity, its immediate
descriptors, and any categorical descriptors.

In addition, by associating properties to those tags, such as a `concave` shape
that is `hollow` and has a `solid` body, can be used to collect `liquid`, such as using a cup,
a bowl, or even just your hands together to scoop water, you could then drink from it.
This level of detail is expected to allow significant degrees of problem solving
that less association based solutions may not allow. This will front load
work in describing capabilities, but with the categorization association, should reduce
long term burdens from maintaining a completely unique design of each entity in the simulation.
